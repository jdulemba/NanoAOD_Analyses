gg -> A/H NNLO to LO k-factor

details regarding the derivation of the k-factors can be found in AN-20-133

contents of the file
- sets of 2D graphs whose x and y axis refer to the A/H mass in GeV and relative width in % respectively
  - <A/H>_<res/int>_sushi_nnlo_mg5_lo_kfactor_pdf_325500_<scale> contain the NNLO to LO k-factors
    - <scale> can be one of [nominal, uF_up, uF_down, uR_up, uR_down, uF_up_uR_up, uF_down_uR_down], referring to the scale choice variations
    - uF refers to variations in factorization scale, and uR variations in the renormalization scale
    - up and down are multiplication by 2 and 0.5 respectively
  - <A/H>_<res/int>_mg5_pdf_325500_scale_dyn_0p5mtt_<scale>_<type>_<channel> contain the MG5 LO cross section for the relevant process and channel in pb
    - <type> is either xsec, referring to the sum of event weights with their signs kept; xabs, referring to the sum of the magnitude of event weights; positive_event_fraction, referring to the fraction of positive events in the interference sample
    - all cross sections are computed assuming stable top quarks and multiplied by the PDG 2020 branching ratios per channel
    - this is done in this way to get around the issue that NWA used by Madgraph leads to inconsistent BRs between channels and between signal and SM samples
    - the event fraction is sampled from the events of the respective channel, without assuming stable top quarks

important notes
- in the scenario where scale-varied k-factors are used, it is important that scale-varied signal is normalized using only the nominal cross section, and then the scale variations are re-normalized so as to induce no cross section variations in the analysis
- due to difference in job sizes, and to ensure the proper usage of the numbers within this file, the signal event weights must be normalized by the magnitude of the nominal event weight at the generator level i.e. nominal generator-level weight must be +-1
