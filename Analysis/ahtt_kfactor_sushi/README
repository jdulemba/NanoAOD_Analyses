gg -> A/H NNLO to LO k-factor

details regarding the derivation of the k-factors can be found in AN-20-133

contents of the file
- sets of 2D histograms whose x and y axis refer to the A/H mass in GeV and relative width in % respectively
  - <A/H>_int_mg5_pdf_325500_scale_dyn_0p5mtt_positive_event_fraction contain the fraction of positive events for each signal points
  - <A/H>_<res/int>_sushi_nnlo_mg5_lo_kfactor_pdf_325500_<scale> contain the NNLO to LO k-factors
    - <scale> can be one of [nominal, uF_up, uF_down, uR_up, uR_down, uF_up_uR_up, uF_down_uR_down], referring to the scale choice variations
    - uF refers to variations in factorization scale, and uR variations in the renormalization scale
    - up and down are multiplication by 2 and 0.5 respectively
  - <A/H>_<res/int>_mg5_pdf_325500_scale_dyn_0p5mtt_<scale>_<type>_<channel> contain the MG5 LO cross section for the relevant process and channel
    - <type> can be either xsec for actual cross section or xabs for the absolute cross section i.e. sum of the magnitude of positive and negative parts of the cross section
    - all cross sections computed assuming stable top quarks and multiplied by the PDG 2020 branching ratios
    - this is done in this way to get around the issue that NWA used by Madgraph leads to inconsistent BRs between channels and between signal and SM samples

important notes
- in the scenario where scale-varied k-factors are used, it is important that scale-varied signal is normalized using only the nominal histogram, and then the scale variations are re-normalized so as to induce no cross section variations in the analysis
- the bin edges of all histograms are arbitrarily chosen; to retrieve the correct signal point hist->FindBin(mass, relative width) should be used; do not assume that the signal point is at bin center

signal points
- 2D grid of
  - mass: 365, 380, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 525, 550, 575, 600, 625, 650, 675, 700, 725, 750, 775, 800, 825, 850, 875, 900, 925, 950, 975, 1000 GeV
  - relative width: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 21, 25 %
